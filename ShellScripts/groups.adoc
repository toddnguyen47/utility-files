= Groups

In order to access our `storage` documents, we will ensure that all users will be under the
group `storage-disk` with the group ID (GID) of `57341`. In other words, in a Debian environment,
run the following commands:

[source, bash]
----
sudo groupadd --gid=57341 storage-disk
sudo usermod -a -G storage-disk $USER
----

After running the two commands above, log out then log back in. After, run the `id` command.
You should see the group `57341(storage-disk)` in the output.

[source, bash]
----
id | grep "57341(storage-disk)"
----

Then you're all set!
