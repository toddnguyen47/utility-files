= Groups

In order to access our `storage` documents, we will ensure that all users will be under the
group `storage-disk` with the group ID (GID) of `57341`. In other words, in a Debian environment,
run the following commands:

[source, bash]
----
sudo groupadd --gid=57341 storage-disk
sudo usermod -a -G storage-disk $USER
----
