Various RegEx expressions.

== Date

Original: https://stackoverflow.com/q/15491894

Edited by me :D It doesn't calculate leap years or February's lower amount of dates, but good enough.

^(0[1-9]|1[012])[- \/.](0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])[- \/.](\d{4})$

== Fancier Date

The RegEx has the following smarts:

* On Jan, Mar, May, Jul, Aug, Oct, and Dec, check for 31 days
* On Apr, Jun, Sep, and Nov, check for 30 days
* On Feb, check for 29 days. No leap year calculation here!
